# Interaction Flows and AI Opportunities

This document outlines various interaction flows and details how AI agents, as part of the **Agent Orchestration Fabric**, can optimize them.

## 1. Successful Flow: New Order and Installation

This flow describes the ideal scenario from placing an order to successful installation.

1.  **Persona:** `David` (Dealer) places an order for 10 "Duette® Honeycomb Shades".
2.  **System:** Creates `Order` "order_3" with `status: 'new'`.
3.  **Persona:** `Maria` (Production Planner) reviews the order.
4.  **System:** Allocates components and updates `Order` status to `'in_progress'`.
5.  **Entity:** `Plant`s manufacture the product.
6.  **System:** Updates `Order` status to `'shipped'`.
7.  **Persona:** `David` (Dealer) receives the shipment and confirms delivery.
8.  **Entity:** `Installer` successfully installs the shades.
9.  **System:** `Order` status is updated to `'completed'`.

### AI Opportunities

*   **Conversational Ordering (Interaction Hub):** An AI agent within the **Interaction Hub** could allow `David` to place orders using natural language.
*   **Automated Order Validation (Investigation Agent):** A specialized **`Investigation Agent`** can automate the review process. It would query the **`Knowledge Graph`** to verify component dependencies and the **`Federated Integration Mesh`** to check real-time inventory in the ERP, freeing up the planner to focus on exceptions.
*   **Proactive Status Updates (Interaction Hub):** An agent can proactively push real-time status updates from the manufacturing and logistics systems (via the **`Federated Integration Mesh`**) to the dealer's workspace in the **Interaction Hub**.

## 2. Failure Flow: Component Out of Stock

This flow describes what happens when a component is not available.

1.  **Persona:** `David` (Dealer) places an order for 5 "Silhouette® Window Shadings".
2.  **System:** The `Investigation Agent` checks inventory and finds that `fabric_2` is out of stock.
3.  **System:** The agent raises an alert for `Maria` (Planner) and puts the order `on_hold`.
4.  **Persona:** `Michael` (Account Manager) is notified.
5.  **Persona:** `David` (Dealer) decides to wait.

### AI Opportunities

*   **Intelligent Dealer Communication (Interaction Hub):** An agent in the **Interaction Hub** can automate the notification. It would inform `David` about the delay (data from the **`Federated Integration Mesh`**) and query the **`Knowledge Graph`** to suggest alternative branded products that are in stock and can be shipped immediately.

## 3. Failure Flow: Damaged Product on Arrival

This flow describes the process for handling a product that arrives damaged.

1.  **Persona:** `David` (Dealer) receives a damaged product.
2.  **Persona:** `David` creates a new support ticket (Claim).
3.  **Persona:** `Sarah` (Support Agent) is assigned the claim.
4.  **Persona:** `Sarah` investigates and initiates a replacement.

### AI Opportunities

*   **Guided Claims Intake (Interaction Hub):** A conversational agent in the **Interaction Hub** guides `David` through the submission, ensuring all necessary information is collected upfront.
*   **Automated Triage & Resolution (Support Triage & Investigation Agents):** A **`Support Triage Agent`** first classifies and enriches the incoming claim. It then triggers an **`Investigation Agent`** that queries the **`Knowledge Graph`** for order history and uses the **`Vector Store`** to compare the claim description against past cases. If the claim is within policy (checked by a **`Policy & Compliance Agent`**), it can automatically initiate a replacement. The entire resolution is then passed to a **`Playbook Author Agent`** to create a new playbook if the case is novel.

## 4. Failure Flow: Installation Issue

This flow describes how to handle an issue during the installation process.

1.  **Entity:** `Installer` discovers a missing part during installation.
2.  **Entity:** `Installer` contacts the dealer, who contacts manufacturer support.
3.  **Persona:** `Sarah` (Support Agent) verifies the order and arranges for a replacement part.

### AI Opportunities

*   **On-Site Installer Support (Knowledge Services):** An **"Installer Support Agent"** can be the first line of support. It uses the **`Vector Store`** to find solutions in installation manuals and the **`Knowledge Graph`** to understand the product's component dependencies. If the issue is new, the resolution is captured and sent to a **`Playbook Author Agent`** to enrich the knowledge base for future incidents.

## 5. New Flow: Proactive Maintenance Alert

This flow describes how AI can predict and prevent product failures.

1.  **System:** An AI agent monitors the age and usage data of products in the field.
2.  **System:** The agent identifies a product with a high risk of a component failing soon.
3.  **System:** The agent proactively notifies the dealer and suggests a preventative maintenance action.
4.  **Persona:** `David` (Dealer) reviews and approves the action.

### AI Opportunities

*   **Predictive Lifecycle Management (Metrics & Insight Agent):** A specialized **`Metrics & Insight Agent`** analyzes historical data from the **`Knowledge Graph`** and long-term episodic memory. By identifying systemic issues, it can predict failures, improving customer experience and preventing costly, urgent failures.

## 6. New Flow: Complex Product Configuration

This flow describes how AI can assist in ordering highly customized products.

1.  **Persona:** `David` (Dealer) needs to order a complex, multi-option product.
2.  **System:** A configuration agent guides `David` through the available options.
3.  **System:** The agent ensures all selected options are compatible and provides a real-time visualization.
4.  **System:** The agent generates a quote.
5.  **Persona:** `David` confirms the order.

### AI Opportunities

*   **Guided Configuration (Interaction Hub & Knowledge Graph):** A **"Configuration Agent"** acts as an expert assistant within the **Interaction Hub**. It uses the **`Knowledge Graph`** to understand complex product compatibility rules and dependencies, preventing configuration errors and reducing the need for support calls.

## 7. New Flow: Dealer Onboarding

This flow describes how to efficiently onboard a new dealer.

1.  **Persona:** A new dealer signs up on the manufacturer's portal.
2.  **System:** An onboarding agent initiates the process.
3.  **System:** The agent provides personalized training materials and tutorials.
4.  **System:** The agent helps the dealer set up their account, payment methods, and branding preferences.
5.  **System:** The agent schedules a follow-up call with a human account manager.

### AI Opportunities

*   **Automated Onboarding (Interaction Hub & Vector Store):** An **"Onboarding Agent"** in the **Interaction Hub** automates the initial setup. It provides a consistent, guided experience by pulling personalized training materials from the **`Vector Store`**. This allows `Michael` (Account Manager) to focus his time on relationship-building rather than on administrative tasks.

## Multi-Agent Synergy Scenarios

*   **Out-of-Stock Mitigation:** `Investigation Agent` confirms shortages, `Policy & Compliance Agent` checks substitution rules, and an `Interaction Hub Agent` automatically updates the dealer with approved alternatives.
*   **Installation Issue Escalation:** `Installer Support Agent` troubleshoots on-site, `Playbook Author Agent` captures novel fixes, and `Metrics & Insight Agent` surfaces systemic component failures for manufacturing feedback.
*   **Proactive Maintenance Outreach:** `Metrics & Insight Agent` forecasts risk, `Policy & Compliance Agent` validates coverage, and `Playbook Author Agent` drafts proactive, compliant outreach so dealers receive actionable plans in advance.
